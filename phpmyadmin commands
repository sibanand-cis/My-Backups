>for "Another daemon is already running" issue
Q: i’m trying to start lampp from terminal as it follows:
root@ecds-09:~# /opt/lampp/lampp start
the result is:
Starting XAMPP for Linux 1.7.2…
XAMPP: Another web server daemon is already running.
XAMPP: Another MySQL daemon is already running.
XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD…
XAMPP for Linux started.

So, Another web server daemon is already running!!what is wrong?

To  solve this problem you only have to:

1) To stop apache2 server. Just type in terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
The web server apache2 will be stopped now.

2) To stop MySQL. Just type in terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
To start lampp, just type again: sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

Now you can type in your browser : http://localhost/phpmyadmin for example!
